(Explain why the plot makes (or doesn't make sense) **Overall the graph makes logical sense. \"Suit\" which had the highest proportion of fit, fits the best because it is a tailored item and one typically knows their specific sizes. \"Vest\" on the other hand tend to not be specifically tailored, so it makes sense that the fit would be worse (and it is the lowest scored item).  Some of the other items that scored low for fit--pants and shirts--are also items that everyone usually struggles with.  They are either a bit too long or too short or too snug, but never just right.  It is an overall good graph becasue everything is labed, color coordinated, and has axis. **\n",

    "    1. (Explain first strategy) **One could use machine learnign or AI to have people video themselves to calculate size better.**\n",
