    "**Rationale** Texts have become one of the most ubiquitous forms of marketing data in the digital economy. Perhaps nowhere is this more prevalent than in the online reviews domain. In our notes, we examined how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to Yelp restaurant reviews. On this homework assignment, you will apply the same tools to mine TripAdvisor hotel reviews. This dataset includes all TripAdvisor reviews written in 2015 (through part of 2016) for high review volume Vegas resorts and was collected as part of a large web crawl of over 50 Million online reviews at over 428k worldwide hotels by your professor and his colleague, Dr. Alex Chaudhry in 2016. \n",

    "* vegas_2015_reviews.csv contains the reviews \n",

    "1. This is a walkthrough tutorial, mostly. I have provided you with most of the necessary code. Your job is to run it, read it, understand how it relates to NLP concepts.\n",
    "1. There are many questions throughout. You will primarily be graded on these.\n",
    "1. There are a few places where I ask you to write some code. Pay attention to every cell, make sure you don't skip a cell that you must fill in on accident. Hopefully, this foces you to read through the code thoroughly."

Highly recommend this hotel and when we go back we won't stay anywhere else as you cannot beat the balcony to sit and watch the world go by and soak up the atmosphere.\n",

    "1. **Answer here:  Some did and some didn't.  In some cases the keywords seemed to intuitively correspond to the rating/polarity.  However, in other cases, the key words were nouns that seemed to be neutral and not add much value.  In one review \"stay anywhere else\" was identified as a key word, but this could be used in very high or very low rated hotel reviews.  Additionally, since \"won't\" is in our list of stop words, it seems like the baby has been thrown out with the bath water--the words that determine the directionality of \"stay anywhere else\" have already been eliminated from the corpus.**"
